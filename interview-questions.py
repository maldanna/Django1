Both are totally different where the redirect gives the HttpResponseRedirect for the argument you have passed.

example

return redirect('https://example.com/')   in this we cant send context just will forward url to template or
outside websites i..e httpresponse

takes you to the https://example.com/ page
 where as render will take you to template
