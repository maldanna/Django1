note:we can goto particular template from projects urls as well as from app urls based on type code 
  to forward to url to template we have to import app's views in project urls page 


form django.contri.auth as auth_views

geenerally django providing super authentication in built system for all authentication purpose

1. login and logout are in built class based views  we have to send url form projects urls only 
2.login and logout and remaing stuff(rest confirmatin ..etc)  for all this we have to implement templates
